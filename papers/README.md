# Framing

## CULTURAL DIMENSIONS AND FRAMING THE INTERNET IN CHINA
A multilevel hierarchical model of influences on media content - Shoemaker and Reese (1996). It consists of 5 levels
    * Individual: personal attitudes and orientations of media workers
    * Media routines: the routines of media work (i.e. deadlines, the beat system, notions of newsworthiness, official sources).
    * Organization: corporate policies, political endorsements, editorial positions
    * Extra-media: the effect of the economic environment, the marketplace, cultural and national variables and public relations activities
    * Ideological level: societal definitions of deviance and normalcy or the influence of power centres within society
Previous studies focused on lower levels. Not many studies have been done to test the significance of the factors at the higher level. This study attempts to examine the influence of factors in Shoemaker and Reese’s model **at the ideological levels** on news coverage, and examining this between societies and countries.

> This study focuses on how the underlying cultural differences across societies are associated with newspapers’ presentation of Internet related issues and news frames. The examination is based on a quantitative content analysis of the articles in eight newspapers selected from two eastern societies,
**Hong Kong and Singapore**, and two western societies, **the US and the UK**, during the time period from **2000 to 2004**.

According to Scheufele (1999, 2000), there are 4 distinct processes that may be examined:
1. frame-building
2. frame-setting
3. individual-level outcomes of framing 
4. a feedback loop from audiences to journalists

This study focuses on (1), frame-building from `objective reality` through `media` to `news frames`.

The term `framing` refers to the selection of various issues related to the Internet in China and the process of presenting those issues.

Accordingly, `news frames`, as a result of framing, refer to the generic ways to present certain issues concerning the Internet in China in news stories

Previous studies identified at least 6 *generic news frames*:
* human interest
* responsibility
* morality
* economic consequences
* conflict
* leadership
