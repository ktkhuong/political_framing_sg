# Cutural dimensions and framing the internet in Chinae
A multilevel hierarchical model of influences on media content - Shoemaker and Reese (1996). It consists of 5 levels
    * Individual: personal attitudes and orientations of media workers
    * Media routines: the routines of media work (i.e. deadlines, the beat system, notions of newsworthiness, official sources).
    * Organization: corporate policies, political endorsements, editorial positions
    * Extra-media: the effect of the economic environment, the marketplace, cultural and national variables and public relations activities
    * Ideological level: societal definitions of deviance and normalcy or the influence of power centres within society
Previous studies focused on lower levels. Not many studies have been done to test the significance of the factors at the higher level. This study attempts to examine the influence of factors in Shoemaker and Reese’s model **at the ideological levels** on news coverage, and examining this between societies and countries.

> This study focuses on how the underlying cultural differences across societies are associated with newspapers’ presentation of Internet related issues and news frames. The examination is based on a quantitative content analysis of the articles in eight newspapers selected from two eastern societies,
**Hong Kong and Singapore**, and two western societies, **the US and the UK**, during the time period from **2000 to 2004**.

According to Scheufele (1999, 2000), there are 4 distinct processes that may be examined:
1. frame-building
2. frame-setting
3. individual-level outcomes of framing 
4. a feedback loop from audiences to journalists

This study focuses on (1), frame-building from `objective reality` through `media` to `news frames`.

The term `framing` refers to the selection of various issues related to the Internet in China and the process of presenting those issues.

Accordingly, `news frames`, as a result of framing, refer to the generic ways to present certain issues concerning the Internet in China in news stories

Previous studies identified at least 6 *generic news frames*:
* Human interest: brings an individual's story or an emotional angle to the presentation of an event, issue, or problem.
* Responsibility: present an issue or problem in such a way as to attribute responsibility for its cause or solution to either the government or to an individual or group.
* Morality: interpret an issue, event or problem in terms of "moral prescription", such as presenting moral messages, or offering ‘specific social prescriptions about how to behave.
* Economic consequences: the actual or potential economic impact or consequences of an event, issue, action or problem on individuals, societies or nations are emphasized
* Conflict: conflict between individuals, groups, or institutions as a means of capturing audience interests
* Leadership: activities, actions or speech of a leader of a nation, group, government agency or an institution, or the discussion and assessment of leadership are highlighted
* Factual frame: presenting events or issues in a straightforward fashion without indication of implications

# Perpetual development journalism? Balance and framing in the 2006 Singapore election coverage
## Press models:
* The authoritarian model: government authorities control media and suppress government criticism.
* The libertarian model: allows press freedom among its mostly advertiser-supported commercial media, which compete for audiences and are supposedly freer from government pressure than government-funded media. Private media, largely independent of political parties, competing to deliver news to mass audiences regardless of political affiliation.
* The social responsibility model: the media remain commercial, but the model emphasizes the press’s ethical duties to educate society and assure that the full diversity of community views are heard, including minorities. It recommends regulation to meet these goals if
ultimately necessary.
* The development model: the press as cooperating with government as a ‘catalyst for education, economic growth, and national development. a
balance between the libertarian and communist press models.

## Balance in the social responsibility model and the development model
The precise duties of the press to the public: objectivity (which also encompasses factuality (which includes subcomponents truth and relevance)), balance, and fairness,

Our study examines election coverage using a conception of balance based on Westerstahl’s (1985), which includes the amount of coverage devoted to parties and positive or negative perspectives on the parties.

Questions:
* RQ1: Did the Straits Times feature more news articles focusing on the PAP than on opposition parties?
* RQ2: Did the Straits Times feature a higher percentage of favorable PAP-dominant articles than favorable opposition-dominant articles?
* RQ3: Did the Straits Times feature more front-page PAP-dominant articles than front-page opposition-dominant articles?
* RQ4: What is the dominant type of frame in the Straits Times’ coverage of the 2006 Singapore General Election?

## Framing election coverage
In news reporting, framing means that journalists prioritize certain elements of an event and use these elements to form the report, which may induce readers to interpret the event in a certain manner.

Our study concentrates on **issue-framed articles** which emphasize substantive campaign issues, like policy choices, versus game-framed articles, which emphasize competition of candidates and parties.

## News framing in development journalism
Commercial media, under pressure to attract readers, generally adopt what are regarded as traditional news values, such as featuring conflict and timeliness, and political drama that they perceive as interesting to voters, which may be at odds with what candidates wish to convey and what voters need to know to make educated choices about the candidates’ positions or ability to perform in office

According to media intrusion theory, for election stories, the media tend to use game frames, which fit better than issue-framed stories with journalistic values such as conflict, proximity, and timeliness.

## Variables coded
PAP vs opposition (WP, SDP, etc)

## Metrics
### Balance
* Amount of coverage: each article was categorized according to the political party it focused on predominantly (PAP or an opposition party), as measured by the area of text.
* Overall tone of text: the favorability of coverage toward one party or the other: classified as ‘favorable,’ ‘neutral,’ or ‘unfavorable’ toward that party 
* Article placement: classified as either front page or inside page.

### Framing
The deductive approach (Semetko & Valkenburg, 2000) to examine the types of frames used in the news articles, first defining frames that might appear before coding each article for their presence.

The inductive approach, where **news articles are analyzed with an open mind in order to identify all possible frames** (Semetko & Valkenburg, 2000), could reveal the many ways to frame a story about a given event.

**Cohen’s kappa**: Cohen’s kappa measures the agreement between two raters who each classify N items into C mutually exclusive categories. https://towardsdatascience.com/cohens-kappa-9786ceceab58

# Framing European Politics: A Content Analysis of Press and Television News
A framing effect is "one in which salient attributes of a message (its organization, selection of content, or thematic structure) render particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations"

Experiments with question wording show that the framing of choices can have profound consequences for respondents' perception of risk.

Frames have also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions. The opinion of European publics about the European Union and various EU-related issues can easily be swayed in different directions, depending on how the issue is framed in the survey question.

**The inductive approach** involves analyzing a news story with an open view to attempt to reveal the array of possible frames, beginning with very loosely defined preconceptions of these frames.

**A deductive approach** involves predefining certain frames as content analytic variables to verify the extent to which these frames occur in the news.

**Conflict frame**: This frame emphasizes conflict between individuals, groups, or institutions as a means of capturing audience interest
**Human interest frame**: This frame brings a human face or an emotional angle to the presentation of an event, issue, or problem.
**Economic consequences frame**: This frame reports an event, problem, or issue in terms of the consequences it will have economically on an individual, group, institution, region, or country.
**Morality frame**: This frame puts the event, problem, or issue in the context of religious tenets or moral prescriptions.
**Responsibility frame**: This frame presents an issue or problem in such a way asto attribute responsibility for its cause or solution to either the government or to an individual or group.

* RQ1: Does the use of frames vary significantly by outlet?
* RQ2: Does the use of frames vary significantly by topic?

## Framing measures
To measure the extent to which certain frames appear in stories that mention politics, we developed a series of 20 questions to which the coder had to answer yes (1) or no (0).

Each question was meant to measure one of five news frames: human interest, conflict, morality, attribution of responsibility, and economic consequences.

## Development of Scales to Measure News Frames
Conduct PCA with varimax rotation on the 20 framing questions to investigate the extent to which these reflect underlying dimensions.


# Computational Identification of Media Frames: Strengths, Weaknesses, and Opportunities 

1. Vector space clustering methods: represent each document as a vector of word counts, with each vector as long as the number of words in the corpus vocabulary list. By treating vectors for each document as points in several-hundred-dimensional vector space, documents can be clustered using standard vector space tools.
2. Factor analysis techniques: designed to extract latent variables from high dimensional data. By modeling documents as sets of semantic or lexical variables and then applying factor analysis techniques such as PCA, Latent Semantic Analysis, or Evolutionary Factor Analysis, latent semantic variables can be extracted which represent aspects of the documents under study.
3. Topic modeling methods: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the structural topic model (STM)

The USA Today corpus is much broader. It is the kind of dataset that would allow an analysis of how framing of an entity or subject has changed generally, over longer periods of time.

We therefore evaluate the different frame identification methods subjectively, according to the quality of the frames they have selected. There are no quantitative measures of each of these criteria; they are abstract theoretical qualities about which we make judgments.

1. First, the extent to which the frames identified by the methods fit with our understanding of what a media frame is – an interpretive lens that includes the definition of a problem and a diagnosis of its causes (Entman, 1993, p. 52).
2. Second, the extent to which each identified frame is internally coherent.
3. Third, the extent to which each identified frame is externally differentiable from other potential frames.

## k-means
A named entity recognition system is used to remove peoples’ and organizations’ names.

Automated parts-of-speech tagger to allow the words used to be restricted to only nouns, adjectives, and adverbs. Numbers, times, stopwords and other assumed noise are also rejected.

The resulting bag of word counts is then filtered by overall frequency, retaining terms appearing in between 0.5% and 40% of articles, then tf-idf weighted to downweight common terms, and then made into a Document Term Matrix (DTM) for clustering.

There are two properties of the k-means clustering algorithm which are particularly important for its use in frame identification:
1. Each article is assigned exactly one frame.
2. It tends to split off outlying groups where possible

## Evolutionary Factor Analysis
Similarly to PCA it uses a formal transformation of the input data matrix to create a set of variables which are a linear combination of the input features, but in the case of EFA the factor loadings are generated such that they are **smoothly time-varying** and the particular terms which make up the repertoire of a frame can **evolve over the time period** studied.

## STM
It is similar in approach to LDA, the standard topic model in most academic disciplines, but with the additional ability to condition the topics on covariates.

2 STM models were built.
1. The first uses conventional document pre-processing steps similar to the EFA models. It combines:
    * k-means feature selection stage
    * the STM clustering stage with a large number of topics
    * a final manual analysis stage of selecting and merging the resulting topics to identify frames in a semi-supervised way which draws on both the latent structure of the data and our domain-specific knowledge and understandings of framing.
2. 
    * select the headline and lead paragraph of each article, then use automated parts-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition to keep nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, while discarding peoples’ and organizations’ names, numbers, times, and stopwords.
    * extend the feature selection stage by modeling each document as a combined bag of single words and bi-grams,14 to better model specific phrases used in multiple texts.
    * the resulting term vectors are combined them into a document-term matrix for the whole corpus, filtering out terms that appeared in fewer than 0.5% or greater than 40% of documents.
    * The terms list merge semantically equivalent words and filter terms with no particular semantic meaning for this analysis, treating them as corpus-specific stopwords (this was inspired by EFA’s manual ontology step). 
    * the final feature selection stage was to tf-idf weight the matrix to downweight common terms.

Once the feature matrix was complete, we then fitted STMs for a wide range of values of K, using the standard metrics in STM’s “searchK” function, selecting a final value of K to maximize model fit before fitting a final STM.

As a final step, we characterized each topic according to its keywords and the documents which load on it most heavily, then had two coders independently identify irrelevant topic clusters and attempt to combine those which remained into coherent frame packages.
